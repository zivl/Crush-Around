# Crush Around

##### by Tomer Cagan and Ziv Levy

Mobile games separates the player from his surrounding and his peers. 
Crouching on top of the mobile device, the player is isolated. 

But it doesn’t have to be that way...
**Crush Around** lets the user play in its surrounding by augmenting a game layer on top of the real world which encourages him to open up to the world. In addition, by playing in the real world, the game is meaningful not only to the player but to other people by sharing the game play epic achievements or collaborating with others in wreaking havoc.

In **Crush Around** the gamer points the mobile device camera onto the scene.

The game automatically detect objects in the surrounding, transforming the scene into a game level in which the player can interact by bouncing a ball around (similar to classic “Wall Breaker” games).

The more destruction – the more points (and fun). Several game mechanism ensure that the gamer faces dilemas and tension which makes the experience more rewarding.

The game was developed as part of Game Intelligence course and uses [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) and [Box2D](http://box2d.org) – open source C++ libraries for Computer Vision and physic simulation and is working on multiple platforms such as `iOS`, `Android` and `Win32`.
